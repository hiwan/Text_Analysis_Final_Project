<h1>What Determines Corporate Risk Attitudes?</h1>
This project investigates what determines corporate risk attitudes by comparing risk-seeking American companies and risk-averse Japanese companies through the analysis of news articles. The hypothesis suggests that companies become risk-seeking when prioritizing shareholders and risk-averse when prioritizing employees. Findings revealed that American companies frequently use terms related to shareholders like "investor" and "market," supporting the hypothesis. Conversely, Japanese companies often mention employment-related terms such as "secure," suggesting a focus on maintaining jobs. Interestingly, Japanese firms also scored higher on terms like "risk," "study," and "information," indicating a focus on information gathering to mitigate risks. To stimulate the Japanese economy, which suffers from prolonged stagnation partly due to risk-averse corporate behavior, the study recommends that Japan's corporate laws be amended to prioritize shareholders over other stakeholders, including employees. This policy shift could encourage Japanese firms to pursue profit-maximizing opportunities and take more risks, potentially leading to economic revival.
