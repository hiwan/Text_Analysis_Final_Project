This project investigates what determines corporate risk attitudes by comparing risk-seeking American companies and risk-averse Japanese companies through the analysis of news articles. The hypothesis suggests that companies become risk-seeking when prioritizing shareholders and risk-averse when prioritizing employees. The findings support this, showing that American firms focus more on shareholders while Japanese firms emphasize employee retention. This study recommends that Japan amends corporate laws to prioritize shareholders, encouraging firms to take risks and potentially reviving the economy despite initial job retention concerns.
